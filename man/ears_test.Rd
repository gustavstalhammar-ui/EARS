\title{Event-Adjusted Rank Sum (EARS) Test}
\usage{
ears_test(data, group, time, event)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing your data.}

\item{group}{Name of the grouping variable (character).}

\item{time}{Name of the survival-time variable (character).}

\item{event}{Name of the event indicator (character; 1=event, 0=censored).}
}
\value{
A list with components:
  \describe{
    \item{statistic}{Kruskal–Wallis chi-squared statistic}
    \item{p.value}{Censoring-adjusted P value (≤ 1)}
    \item{method}{Description of the test performed}
    \item{data}{Data.frame of adjusted times (only events)} 
  }
}
\description{
Computes adjusted survival times by dividing each event time by the proportion
of events in its group, then compares distributions across groups with a
Kruskal–Wallis test and adjusts the P value for censoring.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(
  Group = rep(c("A","B"), each=5),

  Event = c(1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1)
